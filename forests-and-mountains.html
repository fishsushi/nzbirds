    <h2>Forests and Mountains</h2>
        <p>In the forests of New Zealand, you can find birds pecking at roots and chattering up in the canopy of trees. Every morning a dawn chorus can be heard coming from a variety of different birds. Birds are an important part of the forest ecosystem and help maintain a healthy food web.</p>

    <h2>Emerging Threats</h2>
    <p>As safe as this habitat once was, invasive species have found their way in and are ruining the balance.</p>

<!-- Pests are a huge issue, especially in alpine and forest areas. This section introduces pests and talks about why they are a threat -->        
        
    <h2>Common Invasive Species</h2>
<p>Most species that currently pose a threat to native species have come from overseas. An example of this is the possum. They were brought from other countries using boats and have been a threat ever since. Many pests kill both eggs and adult birds. Here are some common invasive species to the forests and mountains of NZ:</p>
