<!-- This section introduces the user to the concept of what conservation sanctuaries are -->    
    
    <h2>Other Islands</h2>
    <p>Some species, like the Takahe, are found mainly on predator-free island sanctuaries. These sanctuaries are closely monitored for predators to ensure that protected animals aren't getting attacked. it is important for protected species to have sanctuaries free from predators so that they do not go extinct. One of the most well-known protected birds, the Takahe, was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered and has been protected ever since.</p>

<!-- Description of the procedures taken in conservation sanctuaries to ensure that native birds are protected -->        
        
        <h2>How are these birds protected?</h2>
        <p>The people who take care of these islands and sanctuaries use different measures to keep these animals safe. The main pests who threaten these species are kept off the island by making sure that they havent sneaked onto boats or inside luggage. They also perform regular checks on the birds' health and have ink pads to monitor what animals are roaming around. Predators like rats and possums are not on the island, making it a safe environment for birds to breed and lay eggs.
