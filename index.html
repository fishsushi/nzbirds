    <!-- Quick introduction to NZ birds -->
    
    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>New Zealand is home to various species of birds. From the ancient moa to more recent species, NZ has dense bush and unique birds. With so many birds who are endemic to the country, it is important that extra care is taken so they do not become extinct.</p>

    <!-- A paragraph explaining the term "endemic", which will be important as it is used throughout the site -->    
    
    <h2>What does endemic mean?</h2>
<p>Endemic species are species that can only be found in a specific place or country. For example, if an endemic animal goes extinct in the one country that it's in, that means that it is gone from the entire world. Many endemic birds in NZ are endangered, meaning they are at risk of extinction.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>House cat attacks</li>
            <li>Littering</li>
            <li>Hunting</li>
