    <h2>Coastal Birds</h2>
    <p>What is a shorebird? Shorebirds are birds who have special adaptations to be able to survive in water habitats. This can include webbed feet, bills that are wide for fishing, and a waterproof plumage.</p>
    <p>These birds serve an important role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by regulating the numbers of other consumers in the food web. They are major consumers of invertebrates and prevent water insects from overpopulating and ruining aquatic plants.</p>

        <p>Here are some, but not all, endangered shorebirds:</p>

        <!-- Addressing coastal issues that affect these birds and providing tips on how to help them -->
        
        <h2>What threats do they face?</h2>
        <p>Because most shorebirds are highly migratory, many species are very vulnerable to subtle changes that occur in the environment. Things like even a slight drop or increase in temperature can cause them to migrate to the wrong places at the wrong time, leading to contact with other species that they normally wouldn't come into contact with and catching new diseases.</p>
        <p>They are threatened by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dogs on beaches</li>
            <li>Fishing nets and other forms of litter both in and out of the water</li>
            <li>Habitat destruction</li>
            <li>Climate change</li>
            <li>Pests</li>
            <li>Invasive species</li>
            <li>Crowded beaches</li>
            <li>Hunting, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even small changes to your lifestyle can improve the circumstances for shorebirds to survive. Try things like keeping your dog on a leash at beaches, and correctly disposing fishing nets. With these improvements, you can help threatened species to gradually recover their population.</p>
